## Introduction

Seedwork: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Seedwork.html

If your service is simple, DDD approach may unnecessarily make 
your app more complex because of the level of abstraction it make.

Your should not practice DDD-liked style blindly (like me).

This seedwork is best for DDD architecture style.

## Usage

```
yarn add dino-node-ts-seedwork
```

## Issues

This repo only use for my work at Oraichain Dinohub, not for massively adapting purpose.
Its test coverage is far from 100%, and not coverage with jsdoc annotation too. 
So it may have many bugs, so please create issue report on its github remote.
